Built a desktop application in Java to track and monitor crypto assets in scheduled intervals. Created a dynamic graphical user interface using Swing GUI widget toolkit and implemented the Model-view-controller design pattern to divide the business logic from the user interface. Used jsoup library to scrape and parse HTML documents from the destination website URL.

<!-- In-flight Rocket Telemetry -->
### <a href="https://github.com/Brian-S-Poon/Raspberry-Pi-Pico-Projects/tree/main/Raspberry%20Pi%20Pico%20GT-U7%20GPS%20Module">In-flight Rocket Telemetry</a>
Wrote embedded software in C++ as an avionics programmer of CSULB Beach Launch Team using a Raspberry Pi Pico to test the GT-U7 GPS module with the purpose of vehicle recovery and reusability. Used the TinyGPS++ Arduino library to encode and parse received NMEA data streams.
