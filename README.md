### Personal Projects

<!-- Software Questionnaire -->
### <a href="https://github.com/Brian-S-Poon/Software-Questionnaire">Software Questionnaire</a>
Built a static webpage in HTML and CSS to gather information from undergraduates on their knowledge of programming languages and framework technologies. Packaged a Dockerfile with Apache HTTP Server and created a Docker image to deploy on Amazon Elastic Container Registry and Microsoft Azure Container Registry.

<!-- Artemis -->
### <a href="https://github.com/Brian-S-Poon/Artemis">Artemis</a>
Built a desktop application in Java to track and monitor crypto assets in scheduled intervals. Created a dynamic graphical user interface using Swing GUI widget toolkit and implemented the Model-view-controller design pattern to divide the business logic from the user interface. Used jsoup library to scrape and parse HTML documents from the destination website URL.

<!-- In-flight Rocket Telemetry -->
### <a href="https://github.com/Brian-S-Poon/Raspberry-Pi-Pico-Projects/tree/main/Raspberry%20Pi%20Pico%20GT-U7%20GPS%20Module">In-flight Rocket Telemetry</a>
Wrote embedded software in C++ as an avionics programmer of CSULB Beach Launch Team using a Raspberry Pi Pico to test the GT-U7 GPS module with the purpose of vehicle recovery and reusability. Used the TinyGPS++ Arduino library to encode and parse received NMEA data streams.

<!-- Sorting Algorithm Visualizer -->
### <a href="https://github.com/Brian-S-Poon/Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer">Sorting Algorithm Visualizer</a>
Built a desktop application in Java to visually demonstrate 5 sorting algorithms using Swing GUI widget toolkit. 
Implemented the Model-view-controller architectural pattern along with a finite-state machine for the software architectural design and used the JUnit testing framework to create and run unit tests.

<!--
### Video Streaming Service Management System
Video Streaming Service RDBMS is a relational database management system created for a video streaming service provider.
I designed and structured a Entity-relationship model using Lucidchart.
I implemented data normalization to reduce data redundancy and also generated query reports with abstract data analysis.
