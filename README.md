### Artemis
Built a desktop application in Java to track and monitor crypto assets in scheduled intervals. Created a dynamic graphical user interface using Swing GUI widget toolkit and implemented the Model-view-controller design pattern to divide the business logic from the user interface. Used jsoup library to scrape and parse HTML documents from the destination website URL.

### In-flight Rocket Telemetry
Wrote embedded software in C++ as an avionics programmer of Beach Launch Team using a Raspberry Pi Pico to test the GT-U7 GPS module with the purpose of vehicle recovery and reusability. Used the TinyGPS++ Arduino library to encode and parse received NMEA data streams.
